# Introduction

Health Tracker is an application which I'm using to track weight and blood pressure and progress in losing weight.

There are multiple applications which I could use, however all of the applications own my data and therefore could be considered as security risk. Since I created this application it also doesn't contain any adds which is a nice plus. Application currently supports English and Slovak speaking people and can be used on mobile devices as well as on desktops.

Example of the the application visuals:
