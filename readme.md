# Introduction

I'm working in the company where we are charging time spent on projects on bi-weekly basis and I'm lucky that overtimes are payed. This means that for me it is very important to know how much overtimes I have, when I have to submit my hours using company tools.

Time Tracker is an Oracle APEX application which helps me to track how much time I spent working on project or specific task.

Currently I'm using this application on daily basis hosted on [OCI Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) autonomous database.
