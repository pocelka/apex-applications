# Introduction

Purpose of this application is to track time. I'm working in the company where we are charging time spent on projects on bi-weekly basis and I'm lucky that overtimes are payed. This means that for me it is very important to know how much overtimes I have, when I have to submit my hours using company tools.

This application helps me to track how much time I spent working on project or specific task.

Additional information can be found in the following subsections:
